# markdownforms
Simplify forms and surveys through markdown

## Basic design

- Use basic markdown where possible.
- Annotate "input" fields inside the markdown
- Turn Markdown in-to a static website. 
- Turn input fields in-to user input.
- Store answers in cache.
- A "download" button enables to save the input data for sharing and/or analyzing.
- A import button enables continuing with the survey from other machine or at other moment.
